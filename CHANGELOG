DATE 
  - for 0.1.1
    - cleanup of Messagebox
    - add attr_property so that repaint will automatically happen on changing
      properties.
    - add Table widget
	- rewrite of field traversal so that on_enter and on_leave are always
	executed atomically. There was one case when on_enter was not executed.
	This invalidates @active_index.
