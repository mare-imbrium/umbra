# Umbra

stripped version of canis (ncurses ruby)

 - Minimal functionality
 - Very close to ncurses, should not try to wrap everything
 - load only what you need
 - not necessarily object oriented, that is not a goal
 - should be able to use a file or widget from here without having to copy too much
 - should be able to understand one file without having to understand entire library
 - should be easy for others to change as per their needs, or copy parts.
 - 


Currently, not looking at ALT keys, this may change in the future. Only single and control keys and function keys trapped 
## Installation
